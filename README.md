# Smart snake

This program uses an evolutionary algorithm to create a neural network that can play the [snake game](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)>). After the user stops the evolution process, the best snake is rendered. Smark snake uses [p5 for Python](https://py.processing.org/) to render the snake, and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for calculations.

# Usage

1. Make sure you have [python installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Ashwagandhae/smart-snake
cd smart-snake
```

3. Next, install the packages...
   You can install from requirements.txt:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or, just install manually (there's only 1 package):

```
pip install numpy
```

4. Finally, run the program

```
python3 main.py
```
